# SCCC Shared Elements

This is a library of shared navigation elements used for Suffolk County Community College's website at https://www.sunysuffolk.edu.

## Folder Structure

There are 3 folders here depending on the type of shared element.

 - **shared-footer** – Footer elements used at the bottom of page(s).
 - **shared-header** – Header elements used at the top of page(s). May include navigation elements.
 - **shared-navigation** – Other navigation elements (e.g. breadcrumb nav).

## Update Process

This library serves as the main repository for these files. Deployment stems from the content in the latest branch and should be sync'd to all systems using the shared element.
